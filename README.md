#  NYC Metro Region Home-job Balance Exploration

MUSA 550 Final Project | Jingyi Cai, Shuting Li, Yinan Li

The Questions We Want to Explore:
- How does the Pandemic change the home and job distribution in the NYC Metro Region? (2019 vs. 2021)
- What is the commuting pattern between boroughs/counties?
- What variable contributes to the job-home mismatch?
