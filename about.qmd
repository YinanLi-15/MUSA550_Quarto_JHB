**Jingyi Cai**

As a graduate student at UPenn, I'm immersed in the dynamic world of city planning with a diverse skill set encompassing planning, data analysis, design, and mapping. I care about the sustainable economic development, vibrant public space, and the affordability and equity of city life. I believe city planning is not only about the future, but roots in the past and present. Thus,  I'm driven to uncover the untold stories that shape our cities and help cities imagine and build a brighter vision by policy making, planning and design.

Besides growing to be a city planner, I'm also a keen traveler, whose footprint has covered 4 continents, 17 countries and 100+ cities.

**Shuting Li**

In my role as an urban designer and landscape architect, my passion lies in shaping a more equitable and inclusive society through intentional design. My works includes a great sphere, ranging from promoting equitable growth in informal settlements to advocating for the rights of climate immigrants and addressing justice in agricultural production. Simultaneously, I actively participate in practical areas such as data analysis and urban economics. My aim is to enrich the field of design through rigorous and systematic research, providing valuable insights to empower the creative process. I am committed to creating flexible spaces that accommodate the diverse narratives of all stakeholders, serving as a mediator in fostering meaningful relationships.
